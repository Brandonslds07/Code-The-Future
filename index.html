<u>Introduction to Adidas</u>
<p style="font-family:'verdana">Every great story has a beginning
 This one started in a small town in Bavaria, Germany. After starting out in his mother’s wash kitchen, 
Adi Dassler registered the ‘Gebrüder Dassler Schuhfabrik’ in 1924 and embarked on his mission to provide athletes
 with the best possible equipment. Gold medals in Amsterdam (1928, Lina Radke) and Berlin were first rewards and 
milestones – and only the start of our story.</p>
